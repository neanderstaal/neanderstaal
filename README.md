- 👋 Hi, I’m @neanderstaal
- 👀 I’m interested in how GitHub works, particularly in relation to the maintenance and customisation of WordPress plugins.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything from scratch.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that helps better my understanding of GitHub.
- 📫 How to reach me: send me a message here I guess?
